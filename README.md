## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Software Engineer with 10+ years of experience, mainly in backend development, **Golang, Ruby on Rails, Java, Node.js**, but also with some frontend experience, **React with Typescript**. I'm always open to learn new technologies, and enjoy test-driven development and pair programming.
